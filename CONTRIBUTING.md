# Contributing Guidelines

## Workflow
1) Fork → 2) Feature branch → 3) Pull Request.
Use clear scope, methods, results, and reproduction steps.

## Code Organization
- Datasets → `datasets/`
- Evaluation (quality/expressiveness/latency) → `src/evaluation/`
- Mobile integration feasibility → `src/integration/`
- Preprocessing (text/audio) → `src/preprocessing/`
- Shared helpers → `src/utils/`
- Results (tables/plots) → `results/`
- Technical notes → `reports/`
- Prototyping → `notebooks/`

## Data Policy
- You may commit small datasets and samples needed for reproducibility.
- Respect third-party licenses for any TTS providers and data used.
